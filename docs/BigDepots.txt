How are trains managed at big rail depots:

Lift: collapse a train in a certain depot tile and hide all vehicles of the train.
This way, all functions for dealing with trains in a small depot will work as expected.

Replacing Trains:
If train needs replacement, lift it and proceed.
Then, if possible, place the train again on track. If not, keep it lifted.

Moving wagons/engines, except when replacing:
If needed, lift it and proceed.
Then, if possible, place the train again on track. If not, keep it lifted.

Buying Trains, except when replacing:
Do nothing.
Then, if possible, place the train again on track. If not, keep it lifted.

Selling trains, except when replacing:
If needed, lift it and proceed.
Then, if possible, place the train again on track. If not, keep it lifted.

Leaving depot, except when replacing:
If possible, place the train again on track. If not, keep it lifted.
